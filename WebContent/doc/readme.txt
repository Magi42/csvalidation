Summary:

  Client-side validation for text fields

Description:

  This variation of the standard TextField component allows client-side
  validation of the text field value after each keypress without any
  client-server communication. You have two options for validating
  the values: regular expressions and JavaScript.

  The component is installed as a Jar. You need to compile the widget set,
  either just this one or, if you are using other custom widget sets,
  a combining widget set.

  The component should be considered as beta.
  Compatibility is tested only with Firefox 3.
